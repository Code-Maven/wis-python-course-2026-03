# Basic programming skills (Python)

This is a beginner course suitable for anyone wanting to process scientific data with minimal or no prior knowledge.

## Course objectives:

* To provide a foundation to software development in Python.
* To be able to write programs in Python manually and using AI.
* To be able to use the rich set of 3rd-party Python libraries.

## Course format:

* 10 lectures of 4 academic hours each.
* Extra video recordings to watch.
* Assignments
* Project (or maybe projects)


## Prerequisites:

* Experience with a text editor similar to notepad.
* Understanding of files and directories.

## Version control with git and using GitHub

* Learn the basics of git, GitHub, and Markdown without the extra difficulty of programming.
* Dealing with projects on GitHub(eg. biopython),
* Creating GitHub pages - creating a web site for the student.
* Writing nice documents using Markdown.
* Using git on the command line and in VS Code.

## Content

The following subjects will be covered in the course in a learning spiral. That is, each topic will be addressed multiple times with ever increasing complexity
and **not** in the order they are mentioned here.


* The two main modes of running programs: Interactive vs. batch processing.

* The two main modes of programming: Interactive and exploratory vs. application development
